# Immersive Game Box

<img src="./images/IGB/IGB2.jpg" alt="An interactive room from the company Immersive Gamebox" width="10" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px !important;">

<p>Worked for tech startup Immersive Game Box for 6 months taking on various responsibilities including UX Design, taking on technical support roles and putting together the physical Game Boxes</p> 

As with all new startups, this required being very agile & wearing a lot of hats. I was simultaneously an Mixed Reality User Experience Designer using Unity, a motion capture technician, an Audio Visual tech, builder of the gamebox (the console itself) and learnt the importance of proper GitHub use.

<h2>Tech Test Adventure</h2>

Below is the UX design for the Tech Test Adventure which we made which was a way of teaching new on site employees how to interact with the gameboxes. Thinking about how to interact on such a large scale meant I had to wrap my head around Mixed Reality workflows, and I was introduced to the IGB Unity set up.
