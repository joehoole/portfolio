	<h1>About</h1>
	<br>



<p>Joe Hoole is a multimedia artist and researcher whose work focuses on access to technology. In his artwork Joe studies into the ethical issues that computerised tools create, showing how tech can be maligned by the giants of the sector, utilised to harm and damage the human communities it professed to help. 
	His research based art project, <a href="simulated-solidarity">Simulated Solidarity</a>, best exemplifies this crossover, which was completed during a Master's in Research at the Creative Computing Institute in University of the Arts London.
<br> <br>
	An ardent believer in the freedom of knowledge, Joe teaches digital tools to students aged 6 to 60 years old. Joe has taught on the Design Museum's digital design programme since 2017 and has taken ability to many heights, being part of red carpet events for the London Film Festival, and teaching online classes to schools as far reaching as Beijing University
	 during the lockdown. He also recently began teaching on the Fine Arts: Computational Arts Bachelors programme at Camberwell College of Arts, part of the University of the Arts London. He is the founder of a Community Interest Corporation, <a href="https://www.tinkerstudios.co.uk">Tinker Studios</a>, that keeps to this commitment of teaching tech to all. 
	<br> <br>
	The convergence of design, education, and ethical decision making forms Joe's skillset, on top of all that he has a professional ability at 3d Modelling, and front end Web Development. He is a games designer with an interest in the world of XR and has a full working knowledge of the Adobe Suite. </p>
